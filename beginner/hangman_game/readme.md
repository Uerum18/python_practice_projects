This is a simple implementation of a word guessing game commonly known as "Hangman." 
Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The variable user_selections is initialized as an empty list. This list will keep track of the letters guessed by the user.
2. The function pick_word() is defined. It selects a random word from the utils.words list and initializes a mask string with underscores representing the unknown letters in the word. It then prints the mask and returns a dictionary containing the word, mask, and an empty list for letters.
3. The function user_guess(task, user_life) handles user input for guessing a letter. It takes two parameters: task, which is a dictionary containing the word, mask, and letters, and user_life, which represents the number of remaining lives.
4. Inside user_guess(), the user is prompted to enter a letter. The function performs some checks:
  4.1. If the guess contains more than one letter, it prints an error message and returns 0.
  4.2. If the guess has already been selected by the user, it prints an error message and returns 0.
  4.3. If the guess is not present in the word, the guess is added to user_selections, and if there are more than one life remaining, it prints a message indicating the remaining lives and the updated mask. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating the last chance and the mask.
  4.4. If the guess is correct, it adds the guess to user_selections and calls the replace_mask() function to update the mask with the correct letter. Then, it prints a success message and the updated mask.
5. The function replace_mask(task, letter) is responsible for replacing the underscores in the mask with the correct letter at their corresponding positions in the word.
6. The function play_game(user_life=6) starts the game. It initializes a new word by calling pick_word(). It enters a loop where the user continues to guess letters until the game ends. The loop checks if the user has run out of lives (user_life == 0) or if the mask matches the word (word['word'] == word['mask']).
7, Inside the loop, the function calls user_guess() to get the user's guess and updates the user's remaining lives accordingly. It also prints a hangman ASCII art corresponding to the number of remaining lives.
8. If the user has run out of lives, it prints a losing message along with the correct word. Otherwise, it prints a winning message with the correct word.
9. After the game ends, the code asks the user if they want to play again. If the user inputs 'n' or 'no', the loop breaks, and the code says "Goodbye!" If the user inputs 'y' or 'yes', the user_selections list is cleared to start a new game. If the user inputs anything else, the code prints "Incorrect input. Game over." and breaks the loop.
