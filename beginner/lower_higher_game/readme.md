A simplified version of a game where the user compares follower counts between two social media accounts. 
Here's how the code works:
1. The game() function is called to start the game.
2. The variable selected_accounts is initialized as an empty list to keep track of the accounts that have been selected before.
3. The variable user_score is initialized as 0 to keep track of the user's score.
4. The function pick_account() is defined. It randomly selects an account from the game_data.data list that hasn't been selected before. It adds the selected account to selected_accounts and returns the account.
5. The function check_results(acc_a, acc_b, user_pick) compares the follower counts between two accounts (acc_a and acc_b) based on the user's choice (user_pick). It returns True if the user's guess is correct (the follower count of acc_a is greater when the user selects 'A' or the follower count of acc_a is smaller when the user selects 'B'). Otherwise, it returns False. If the user enters an invalid selection, an error message is printed, and False is returned.
6. The function game(acc_a=None) represents a round of the game. It takes an optional parameter acc_a, which allows passing a pre-selected account (used for recursive calls). If acc_a is not provided, it calls pick_account() to select a new account.
7. Inside the game() function, it prints the details of acc_a and acc_b accounts using their respective properties (name, description, country). It prompts the user to guess which account has more followers by entering 'A' or 'B'.
8. The code calls the check_results() function with acc_a, acc_b, and the user's pick to check if the user's guess is correct. 
  8.1. If it's correct, the user's score is incremented by 1, and a success message is printed along with the updated score. Then, the function recursively calls itself with acc_b as the new acc_a to continue the game with the next pair of accounts. 
  8.2. If the user's guess is incorrect, a failure message is printed along with the final score.
